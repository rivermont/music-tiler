*I do not own or claim to own any of the artwork in this image. All artwork is copyright their respective authors.*

## About
Given a folder, will either tile all of the images (with a certain extension?) in that folder ***or*** use the Python [mutagen](#) library to extract all album covers from music files (with `.mp3`, `.m4a`, etc).
